          <h3>Dholavira (Gujarat)</h3>
          <p>Dholavira, located in Gujarat’s Kutch district, is one of the largest and most prominent cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in India. Discovered in 1967, it stands out for its unique use of stone architecture and an advanced system of water conservation. The city was carefully planned and divided into three parts – the citadel, middle town, and lower town – all fortified by massive walls. Its most remarkable feature is the sophisticated water management system, including large reservoirs, step-wells, and channels to store rainwater, which was essential in the arid Kutch region. Excavations have also revealed seals, pottery, beads, tools, and evidence of trade links with Mesopotamia. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2021, Dholavira is considered the best example of Harappan urban planning and engineering in India.</p>

          <p>The Dasavatara Temple at Deogarh (Uttar Pradesh), built in the early 6th century CE during the Gupta period, is one of the earliest surviving examples of Hindu temple architecture in North India. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, it is constructed on a raised platform with a square sanctum (garbhagriha) and traces of a pillared hall.

          <p>The Shalimar Bagh, located on the banks of the Dal Lake in Srinagar, is one of the most famous Mughal gardens in India, built in 1619 CE by Emperor Jahangir for his wife Nur Jahan. It is the largest Mughal garden in Kashmir and a fine example of the Persian Charbagh style, symbolizing paradise on earth. The garden is laid out in a terraced pattern, with flowing water channels, fountains, shaded avenues of chinar trees, and pavilions decorated with intricate Kashmiri artwork. It is divided into three sections: the outer public garden, the central garden for courtiers, and the private royal garden for the emperor and his family. The garden beautifully blends natural scenery with Mughal landscaping, offering panoramic views of the Dal Lake and surrounding mountains.</p>

          <h3>Victoria Memorial (Kolkata)</h3>
          <p>The Victoria Memorial, located in Kolkata, was built between 1906 and 1921 in memory of Queen Victoria after her death in 1901. Commissioned by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, it is one of the most prominent symbols of the British Raj in India. Constructed entirely of white Makrana marble, the memorial combines elements of British, Mughal, Venetian, and Egyptian architectural styles, giving it a unique Indo-Saracenic character. The central dome is crowned with a figure of Victory, and the complex is surrounded by lush gardens and water bodies. Inside, it houses a museum and art gallery with paintings, manuscripts, sculptures, and artifacts from the colonial period, showcasing both British imperial history and aspects of Indian culture.</p>

          <h3>Gateway of India (Mumbai)</h3>
          <p>The Gateway of India, located in Mumbai, is one of the most iconic landmarks of modern India. It was built between 1913 and 1924 to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911. Designed by George Wittet, the monument is constructed in yellow basalt and reinforced concrete, blending Indo-Saracenic, Hindu, and Muslim architectural styles. Standing 26 meters high on the waterfront of the Arabian Sea, it served as a ceremonial entrance to India for British viceroys and governors. Historically, it also marked the symbolic end of British rule, as the last British troops departed through this gateway in 1948. Today, the Gateway of India is not just a colonial-era monument but also a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Mumbai’s heritage, often serving as a starting point for travel to Elephanta Caves and other nearby sites.</p>

          <p>The Rashtrapati Bhavan, situated on Raisina Hill in New Delhi, is the official residence of the President of India and one of the most magnificent and largest presidential residences in the world. Originally constructed as the Viceroy’s House during British rule, it was designed by the famous architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1929 as part of the creation of New Delhi as the new capital of India. The building is an architectural masterpiece, covering 330 acres and consisting of more than 340 rooms spread across four floors, including grand halls, state rooms, and offices. Built in Indo-Saracenic style, it harmoniously combines classical European features with Indian elements such as jalis (lattice screens), chhatris (domed kiosks), and motifs inspired by Indian art and culture. The most celebrated part of the complex is the Mughal Gardens (now Amrit Udyan), designed in the traditional Charbagh style, featuring terraced lawns, fountains, flowerbeds, and rare plant varieties. Beyond its architectural brilliance, the Rashtrapati Bhavan is the nerve center of India’s democracy, serving as the residence and workplace of the Head of State, as well as a symbol of India’s heritage, sovereignty, and unity.</p>

          <p>The Writer’s Building, located in Kolkata, is an iconic colonial-era structure built in 1777 CE by the British East India Company. It was originally constructed to provide office space for the company’s junior clerks, known as “writers,” which is how it got its name. Over time, the building underwent several expansions and renovations, eventually transforming into a grand structure in the Greco-Roman architectural style, with long colonnades, high windows, and statues adorning its façade. After the British period, it became the secretariat building of the Government of West Bengal, housing key administrative offices. The Writer’s Building is not just an administrative landmark but also a site of historical importance, as it was the scene of revolutionary activities during India’s freedom struggle, most notably the attack by the Bengal revolutionaries on Colonel N.S. Simpson in 1930.</p>
