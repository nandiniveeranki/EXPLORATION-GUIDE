                <div class="card-body">
                    <h3>Punjab – Rice (Paddy)</h3>
                    <p>Extensive canal networks and groundwater extraction support high-yield paddy in Punjab. Mechanization, MSP procurement, and milling infrastructure enable scale, though water tables face stress—driving interest in direct-seeded rice and diversification.</p>
                    <p>Punjab, often referred to as the Granary of India, plays a central role in India’s rice cultivation and food security. The large-scale adoption of paddy in the state began during the Green Revolution of the 1960s, when high-yielding varieties, improved irrigation networks, and chemical fertilizers were introduced on a mass scale. Prior to this period, Punjab was primarily a wheat-growing state, but policy incentives, government procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP), and the establishment of the Food Corporation of India’s procurement system encouraged farmers to adopt paddy as the dominant kharif crop.</p>
                    <p>The climatic conditions of Punjab, with hot summers and the arrival of the monsoon rains in June, are favorable for rice cultivation, although the crop is not native to this semi-arid region. To support paddy production, Punjab developed extensive canal systems and relied heavily on tube wells for irrigation. This assured water availability allowed farmers to grow water-intensive rice varieties that required fields to remain flooded for long periods. Districts like Sangrur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Amritsar, and Ferozepur soon became known as the rice belts of Punjab, producing massive surpluses for the national buffer stocks.</p>
                    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/05/41/69/46/1000_F_541694652_8mfBHx40AuqNNR60EpQegwMJSGluZOFB.jpg" alt="Rice field Punjab" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p>Economically, rice farming in Punjab remains viable due to government procurement under MSP. Every harvest season, agencies procure millions of tons of paddy, ensuring assured returns for farmers. However, this has also created a dependence on subsidies, free electricity for tube wells, and continued state support. Policymakers now recognize the urgent need to diversify Punjab’s agriculture, encouraging farmers to shift toward maize, pulses, horticulture, and even high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, rice cultivation in Punjab stands as both a story of agricultural success and an emerging ecological challenge. While it has secured India’s food security for decades, feeding millions and sustaining farmer incomes, the long-term sustainability of paddy in Punjab is under question. Balancing productivity with environmental conservation has become the key priority. Future solutions lie in promoting water-saving technologies, diversifying crop patterns, and equipping farmers with both policy support and scientific innovation to ensure that Punjab remains an agricultural powerhouse without exhausting its natural resources.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h3>Haryana – Rice</h3>
                    <p>Haryana’s rice belt mirrors Punjab’s strengths—assured irrigation, hybrid seed adoption, and efficient procurement. Policy nudges promote water-saving practices, short-duration varieties, and shifting some acreage to maize and pulses.</p>
                    <p>Haryana is one of India’s leading rice-producing states, especially known for its contribution of high-quality basmati rice to both domestic consumption and export markets. The cultivation of rice in Haryana expanded significantly during the Green Revolution, when improved irrigation infrastructure, canal networks, and the introduction of high-yielding varieties transformed the state into a key agricultural hub. Unlike Punjab, which primarily focused on wheat initially, Haryana quickly diversified into rice cultivation due to its proximity to procurement centers and government policies that assured Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers. The state’s fertile alluvial soils and assured irrigation through canals such as the Western Yamuna Canal, coupled with tube well systems, created favorable conditions for large-scale paddy farming. Districts like Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Kaithal, and Panipat became the major rice belts of the state, producing both basmati and non-basmati varieties. Karnal, in particular, is internationally recognized for its basmati rice research and development, with the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) and the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) supporting modern farming practices.<br>
                    Economically, paddy cultivation in Haryana thrives due to strong government procurement, private milling units, and robust export networks. Basmati from Haryana has a global reputation, especially in Middle Eastern and European markets, making it a key foreign exchange earner for India. However, similar to Punjab, the expansion of paddy in a semi-arid state has placed enormous stress on groundwater resources, as farmers rely heavily on tube wells to maintain flooded paddy fields. Declining water tables, rising energy consumption for pumping, and environmental concerns such as soil degradation and methane emissions have prompted policymakers to encourage diversification. Programs promoting crop rotation, water-saving technologies like direct-seeded rice, and alternative crops such as maize and pulses are being introduced.</p>
                    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.gGTFt5nL6tyJOSvLXCmr_gHaEo?cb=ucfimg2&ucfimg=1&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3" alt="Paddy field Haryana" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p>Despite these challenges, Haryana remains synonymous with high-quality rice, particularly basmati, which is deeply tied to the state’s agricultural identity and global standing. The resilience of its farmers, strong institutional support, and policy-driven procurement ensure that rice continues to play a pivotal role in Haryana’s rural economy. At the same time, balancing sustainability with productivity has become the central challenge for the state, as it seeks to maintain its reputation as a leading rice producer while safeguarding its natural resources for the future.</p>

                    <p>India’s leading cotton state benefits from Bt hybrids, ginning capacity, and textile demand. Drip irrigation and IPM practices aim to reduce input costs and pest risks.Gujarat is India’s top cotton producer, supported by extensive cultivation in Saurashtra, Kutch, and central districts. The widespread use of Bt cotton hybrids, strong ginning and pressing infrastructure, and the state’s textile mills create a complete cotton value chain. Drip irrigation, fertigation, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are being adopted to control pink bollworm and reduce input costs. Export-oriented spinning units and farmer producer companies help ensure stable market access and competitive prices for growers.</p>
                    <p>Cotton cultivation in Gujarat benefits from long sunny days, black cotton soils, and robust mandi networks. Farmers increasingly use mechanized pickers, high-density planting, and soil moisture conservation to improve yields. The state’s strong textile ecosystem—spinning mills, garment units, and export hubs in Ahmedabad and Surat—creates consistent demand. Ongoing research on bollworm-resistant hybrids and climate-resilient varieties supports long-term sustainability.</p>

                    <p>World-renowned saffron thrives on Karewa soils. GI tagging, sprinkler irrigation, and post-harvest grading improve purity and farmer earnings in Pampore clusters.J&K produces some of the world’s finest saffron, grown mainly in the Karewa plateaus of Pampore. These elevated, clay-loam soils store moisture and enable the delicate Crocus sativus flower to thrive. Saffron from this region is prized for its high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content, which give superior color, taste, and aroma.
To improve productivity, the government introduced sprinkler irrigation systems, corm renewal programs, and the National Saffron Mission. GI tagging for "Kashmir Saffron" protects authenticity and prevents adulteration in global markets. Modern post-harvest processes like stigmas separation, grading, hygienic drying, and e-trading platforms help secure higher incomes for growers. Saffron tourism in Pampore is also gaining attention.</p>
                    <p>The saffron-growing region of Pampore, often called the “Saffron Bowl of India,” is known for its unique agro-climatic conditions.

                    <p>Deccan orchards produce premium table mangoes. Flowering management, fruit fly control, and export compliance yield better prices in GCC and Southeast Asian markets.Karnataka produces some of India’s best mangoes, including Alphonso (Hapus), Badami, Mallika, and Totapuri. The Deccan climate with dry spells before flowering encourages profuse panicle formation. Farmers practice pruning, paclobutrazol application, and irrigation scheduling to regulate flowering cycles.
Fruit fly traps, bagging, and orchard sanitation improve export-grade quality. Karnataka’s mangoes are shipped to GCC countries, Southeast Asia, and Europe, supported by packhouses, hot-water treatment units, and vapor-heat treatment facilities. FPOs are also promoting branding, GI protection, and traceability, while mango tourism in Chikkaballapur and Ramanagara is becoming popular.</p>
                    <p>Karnataka’s mango orchards benefit from a long, dry summer that enhances fruit sweetness and aroma. Alphonso and Badami from the state are preferred because of their fiberless texture, uniform ripening, and rich flavor. To boost yield consistency, farmers practice alternate-bearing management, nutrient balancing, and organic inputs for soil health.</p>
