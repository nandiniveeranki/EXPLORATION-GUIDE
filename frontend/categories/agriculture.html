        <span>Agriculture is a cornerstone of India's economy, employing about 55% of the population and contributing significantly to the GDP, while also facing challenges such as pesticide use and climate change.</span><br><br>
        India has a rich agricultural history dating back to the Neolithic period. Today, it ranks second globally in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors—animal husbandry, forestry, and fisheries—remain vital for food security, livelihoods, and exports.<br>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h3>Punjab – Rice (Paddy)</h3>
                    <p>Extensive canal networks and groundwater extraction support high-yield paddy in Punjab. Mechanization, MSP procurement, and milling infrastructure enable scale, though water tables face stress—driving interest in direct-seeded rice and diversification.</p>
                    <p>Punjab, often referred to as the Granary of India, plays a central role in India’s rice cultivation and food security. The large-scale adoption of paddy in the state began during the Green Revolution of the 1960s, when high-yielding varieties, improved irrigation networks, and chemical fertilizers were introduced on a mass scale. Prior to this period, Punjab was primarily a wheat-growing state, but policy incentives, government procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP), and the establishment of the Food Corporation of India’s procurement system encouraged farmers to adopt paddy as the dominant kharif crop.</p>
                    <p>The climatic conditions of Punjab, with hot summers and the arrival of the monsoon rains in June, are favorable for rice cultivation, although the crop is not native to this semi-arid region. To support paddy production, Punjab developed extensive canal systems and relied heavily on tube wells for irrigation. This assured water availability allowed farmers to grow water-intensive rice varieties that required fields to remain flooded for long periods. Districts like Sangrur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Amritsar, and Ferozepur soon became known as the rice belts of Punjab, producing massive surpluses for the national buffer stocks.</p>
                    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599487488170-6b168f6c9d7a" alt="Rice field Punjab">
                    <p>Economically, rice farming in Punjab remains viable due to government procurement under MSP. Every harvest season, agencies procure millions of tons of paddy, ensuring assured returns for farmers. However, this has also created a dependence on subsidies, free electricity for tube wells, and continued state support. Policymakers now recognize the urgent need to diversify Punjab’s agriculture, encouraging farmers to shift toward maize, pulses, horticulture, and even high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, rice cultivation in Punjab stands as both a story of agricultural success and an emerging ecological challenge. While it has secured India’s food security for decades, feeding millions and sustaining farmer incomes, the long-term sustainability of paddy in Punjab is under question. Balancing productivity with environmental conservation has become the key priority. Future solutions lie in promoting water-saving technologies, diversifying crop patterns, and equipping farmers with both policy support and scientific innovation to ensure that Punjab remains an agricultural powerhouse without exhausting its natural resources.</p>

            <!-- Haryana Rice -->

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h3>Haryana – Rice</h3>
                    <p>Haryana’s rice belt mirrors Punjab’s strengths—assured irrigation, hybrid seed adoption, and efficient procurement. Policy nudges promote water-saving practices, short-duration varieties, and shifting some acreage to maize and pulses.</p>
                    <p>Haryana is one of India’s leading rice-producing states, especially known for its contribution of high-quality basmati rice to both domestic consumption and export markets. The cultivation of rice in Haryana expanded significantly during the Green Revolution, when improved irrigation infrastructure, canal networks, and the introduction of high-yielding varieties transformed the state into a key agricultural hub. Unlike Punjab, which primarily focused on wheat initially, Haryana quickly diversified into rice cultivation due to its proximity to procurement centers and government policies that assured Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers. The state’s fertile alluvial soils and assured irrigation through canals such as the Western Yamuna Canal, coupled with tube well systems, created favorable conditions for large-scale paddy farming. Districts like Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Kaithal, and Panipat became the major rice belts of the state, producing both basmati and non-basmati varieties. Karnal, in particular, is internationally recognized for its basmati rice research and development, with the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) and the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) supporting modern farming practices.<br>
                    Economically, paddy cultivation in Haryana thrives due to strong government procurement, private milling units, and robust export networks. Basmati from Haryana has a global reputation, especially in Middle Eastern and European markets, making it a key foreign exchange earner for India. However, similar to Punjab, the expansion of paddy in a semi-arid state has placed enormous stress on groundwater resources, as farmers rely heavily on tube wells to maintain flooded paddy fields. Declining water tables, rising energy consumption for pumping, and environmental concerns such as soil degradation and methane emissions have prompted policymakers to encourage diversification. Programs promoting crop rotation, water-saving technologies like direct-seeded rice, and alternative crops such as maize and pulses are being introduced.</p>
                    <img class="card-img-top" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1615890006438-2b2f0f59b905" alt="Paddy field Haryana">
                    <p>Despite these challenges, Haryana remains synonymous with high-quality rice, particularly basmati, which is deeply tied to the state’s agricultural identity and global standing. The resilience of its farmers, strong institutional support, and policy-driven procurement ensure that rice continues to play a pivotal role in Haryana’s rural economy. At the same time, balancing sustainability with productivity has become the central challenge for the state, as it seeks to maintain its reputation as a leading rice producer while safeguarding its natural resources for the future.</p>

                    <span style="color: red;">The Godavari Delta in Andhra Pradesh is one of the most fertile and productive rice-growing regions in India, often referred to as the "Rice Bowl of India."</span> The delta, nourished by the mighty Godavari River and its intricate canal systems, has supported intensive paddy cultivation for centuries. The alluvial soils of the delta are naturally rich in nutrients, and when combined with assured irrigation from river-fed canals, they create ideal conditions for growing multiple crops of rice each year. Farmers in districts such as East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna, and Guntur are known for cultivating high-yielding and hybrid rice varieties, with many farmers adopting double and even triple-cropping patterns to maximize productivity. The arrival of the Green Revolution further boosted rice cultivation here, as improved varieties, mechanization, and chemical inputs found a natural fit in the delta’s favorable environment.</p>
