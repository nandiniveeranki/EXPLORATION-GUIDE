          <h3>Nalanda University (Bihar)</h3>
          <p>Nalanda University in Bihar, founded in the 5th century CE during the Gupta period, was one of the world’s first great residential universities and a symbol of India’s ancient intellectual heritage. It attracted scholars and students from across Asia, including China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Central Asia, who came to study diverse subjects such as philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, grammar, logic, and Buddhism. At its peak, Nalanda housed thousands of students and teachers, supported by a vast library complex known as Dharmaganja, which contained millions of manuscripts covering religion, science, arts, and literature. The university functioned not just as an educational hub but also as a global center for the exchange of ideas, blending Indian knowledge with international influences, and nurturing great scholars like Aryabhata, Dharmapala, and Xuanzang, the famous Chinese traveler who studied and taught there. Its extensive architectural remains, including monasteries and stupas spread across a massive campus, reflect the advanced planning and grandeur of the institution. Although it declined after repeated invasions, most notably its destruction by Bakhtiyar Khilji in the 12th century, Nalanda’s legacy endures as a beacon of knowledge and learning in ancient India, and its ruins are today recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, symbolizing the universality of education and intellectual pursuit.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h3>Vikramashila University (Bihar)</h3>
          <p>Vikramashila University, located in present-day Bihar, was established in the late 8th century CE by King Dharmapala of the Pala dynasty and became one of the most important centers of learning in ancient India, often regarded as a sister institution to Nalanda. It was founded to revive and strengthen Buddhist scholarship and monastic education, particularly in Tantric Buddhism, and soon attracted students and scholars from across India and neighboring countries like Tibet. At its height, Vikramashila housed thousands of monks and teachers, organized into a highly structured system with six main colleges and more than a hundred professors. The university’s vast curriculum included Buddhist philosophy, logic, grammar, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy, and law, making it a holistic educational hub. It gained fame for producing some of the greatest Buddhist scholars, including Atisha Dipankara, who later carried Buddhist teachings to Tibet, shaping Tibetan Buddhism for centuries. The architecture of Vikramashila was grand and well-planned, with a central stupa, monasteries, temples, lecture halls, and a huge library that preserved numerous manuscripts. However, like Nalanda, it was eventually destroyed in the 12th century during the invasions led by Bakhtiyar Khilji, which caused a devastating loss to Indian and world heritage. Today, the ruins at Antichak in Bhagalpur district stand as a reminder of its glorious past, and Vikramashila remains a symbol of India’s scholarly excellence and its role as a global center of Buddhist education.</p>

          <h3>Valabhi University (Gujarat)</h3>
          <p>Valabhi University, located in present-day Gujarat, was a renowned seat of learning in western India between the 6th and 12th centuries CE, flourishing under the Maitraka dynasty. It emerged as a parallel institution to Nalanda in eastern India and gained high reputation as a center for Buddhist studies, particularly Hinayana and Mahayana traditions, while also imparting knowledge in secular subjects like political science, administration, economics, logic, medicine, law, and literature. At its height, Valabhi attracted students and scholars from all over India and neighboring regions, earning recognition from both Indian and foreign chroniclers for its intellectual contributions. The university produced many skilled administrators, teachers, and Buddhist scholars who later played key roles in spreading Buddhist teachings across Asia. Its liberal curriculum and emphasis on practical as well as spiritual learning made it a unique institution, preparing individuals for both governance and monastic life. However, like many other ancient universities, Valabhi’s prominence declined after repeated invasions and political instability in the region by the 12th century, leading to its eventual disappearance. Despite its decline, Valabhi University is remembered as a major hub of learning that helped shape India’s educational and cultural legacy in the early medieval period.</p>

          <h3>Nalanda Mahavihara’s Sister Institutions</h3>
          <p>Nalanda Mahavihara’s sister institutions—Vikramashila, Valabhi, Odantapuri, and Jagaddala—were great centers of Buddhist learning that, along with Nalanda, formed a vast intellectual and spiritual network across ancient India between the 6th and 12th centuries CE. Established mainly under the patronage of the Gupta and Pala dynasties, they specialized in different streams of Buddhist philosophy—Nalanda in Mahayana, Vikramashila in Tantric traditions, Valabhi in both Hinayana and Mahayana along with secular studies, Odantapuri in Mahayana, and Jagaddala in Vajrayana—while also teaching subjects like logic, medicine, astronomy, law, politics, and literature. These institutions attracted thousands of students and scholars from India and abroad, producing legendary teachers such as Atisha Dipankara, and played a key role in transmitting Buddhist thought to Tibet, China, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Their libraries, monasteries, and structured curriculums reflected India’s advanced educational system, but most were eventually destroyed during the 12th-century invasions, leading to a tragic loss of knowledge. Despite their decline, these sister universities remain symbols of India’s golden age of learning, global cultural exchange, and the universality of education.</p>

          <h3>Odantapuri University (Bihar)</h3>
          <p>Odantapuri University, located at Bihar Sharif in Bihar, was one of the earliest Buddhist universities of ancient India and a sister institution to Nalanda, founded in the 8th century CE by the Pala king Gopala. It quickly rose to prominence as a stronghold of Mahayana Buddhism and became an important center for the study of Buddhist philosophy, scriptures, and monastic traditions, while also imparting knowledge in logic, grammar, medicine, and other sciences. The university is believed to have housed thousands of monks and students, with a sprawling campus of monasteries, temples, and lecture halls, and was often compared to Nalanda in scale and influence. Scholars from different parts of India and neighboring regions such as Tibet came to Odantapuri, and it played a significant role in the spread of Buddhism across the Himalayas, leaving a lasting impact on Tibetan monastic education. Like Nalanda and Vikramashila, however, Odantapuri too faced destruction in the late 12th century during the invasions of Bakhtiyar Khilji, leading to a devastating loss of manuscripts, art, and heritage. Today, though little remains of its structures, Odantapuri is remembered as one of the five great universities of the Pala period, symbolizing India’s golden age of Buddhist learning and its contribution to global intellectual traditions.</p>
